DSA Sheet

This DSA sheet contains 280+ DSA questions. DSA sheet covers almost every concept of DSA which will help in understanding DSA concepts in depth. It will also help you to clear the interview rounds of DSA as these questions have been asked in most recent interviews of big tech companies. 

  /*  */
    
Question1 : FIND DUPLICATE NUMBER ?
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question2 : SORT COLORS ?
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question3 : Remove Duplicate From Sorted Array ?
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
  1) Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
  2) Return k.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question4 : Set Matrix Zero ?
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
You must do it in place.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question5 : Move Zeroes ?
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question6 : Buy And Sell Stock (1).

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question7 : Chocolate Distribution Problem.

Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 8, M = 5
A = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing following M packets :{3, 4, 9, 7, 9}.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 7, M = 3
A = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 4 - 2 = 2 by choosing following M packets :{3, 2, 4}.

Your Task:
You don't need to take any input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMinDiff() which takes array A[ ], N and M as input parameters and returns the minimum possible difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question8 : Two Sum.

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question9 : BUY ANS SELL STOCK (II) .

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

Example 3:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Output: []

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question11 : Subarrays Sum Divisible By K .

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7

Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5], k = 9
Output: 0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question12 : Merge Sorted Array .

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question13 : Container With Most Water .

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question14 : Max Points You Obtain From Cards .

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.
In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.
Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.
Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.

Example 1:
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

Example 2:
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

Example 3:
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question18 : Remove Element . 

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question19 : Three Sum .

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]

Output: []

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question22 : Detect Loop In Linked List . 

Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x(position at which tail is connected) = 2
Output: True
Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
x = 0
Output: False
Explanation: For N = 4 ,x = 0 means
then lastNode->next = NULL, then
the Linked list does not contains
any loop.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function detectloop() which contains reference to the head as only argument.  This function should return true if linked list contains loop, else return false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question23 : Remove Linked List Elements . 

Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

Example 2:
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question24 :  Convert Binary Number In a Linked List Element to Integer . 

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question25 : Intersection Of Two Linked List . 

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:
The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
Custom Judge:
The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):
    intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
    listA - The first linked list.
    listB - The second linked list.
    skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
    skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Example 2:
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question26 : Delete Nodes Having Greater Value On Right .

Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes in the list which have any node on their right whose value is greater. (Not just immediate Right , but entire List on the Right)

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3
Output: 15 11 6 3
Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are
the elements which have greater elements
on the following nodes. So, after deleting
them, the linked list would like be 15,
11, 6, 3.

Example 2:
Input:
LinkedList = 10->20->30->40->50->60
Output: 60
Explanation: All the nodes except the last
node has a greater value node on its right,
so all the nodes except the last node must
be removed.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function compute() which should modify the list as required and return the head of the modified linked list. 
The printing is done by the driver code,

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question27 : Palindrome Linked List . 

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question28 : Add Two Numbers . 

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question29 : Remove nth Node From End of List . 

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question30 : Flattening a Linked List .

Given a Linked List of size N, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:
(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
Each of the sub-linked-list is in sorted order.
Flatten the Link List such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order. 

Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer.
For more clarity have a look at the printList() function in the driver code.

Example 1:
Input:
5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
|     |     |     |

Output:  5-> 7-> 8- > 10 -> 19-> 20->
22-> 28-> 30-> 35-> 40-> 45-> 50.
Explanation:
The resultant linked lists has every 
node in a single level.
(Note: | represents the bottom pointer.)

Example 2:
Input:
5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
|          |                
7          22   
|          |                 
8          50 
|                           
30              
Output: 5->7->8->10->19->22->28->30->50
Explanation:
The resultant linked lists has every
node in a single level.

(Note: | represents the bottom pointer.)

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Complete the function flatten() that takes the head of the linked list as input parameter and returns the head of flattened link list.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*N*M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
